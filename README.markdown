# Notes about this fork
This is the result of a pairing session between [Mark Myzk](http://www.programmersparadox.com/) and myself ([Larry Karnowski](http://github.com/karnowski)).  We were just trying to see how far we could get on adding Jasmine tests to the tried & true defaultvalue plugin.

# Additions

* added a $("selector").defaultValue() camelcase alias.
* added a test suite runnable via Jasmine-ruby gem
* added this README

# Running the tests

1. from command line run: rake jasmine
1. from your browser surf to: http://localhost:8888
